# Topological K-theory
These are notes from a Winter 2023 eCHT course titled "K-theory", written jointly with Adrián Doña Mateo and Will Bevington. The material presented is not original, but we hope to give a unique perspective. In particular, we are inclined to use categorical arguments whenever available and hope to convince others of the benefits of this approach
